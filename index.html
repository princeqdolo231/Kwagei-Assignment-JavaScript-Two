	<h1>Summary Of DOM Manipulation</h1>
	<h2>What is DOM Manipulation</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>DOM manipulation</strong> is the process of interacting with 
		the DOM API to change or modify an HTML document that will be displayed in a 
		web browser. This HTML document can be changed to add or remove elements, update 
		existing elements, rearrange existing elements, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		By manipulating the DOM, we can create web applications that update the data in 
		a web page without refreshing the page and can change its layout without doing a 
		refresh. Throughout the document, items can be deleted, moved, or rearranged.
	</p>

	<h2>Definition of the (DOM) and Basic concepts</h2>
	<p>
		The DOM in dom manipulation in javascript stands for Document Object Model. 
		The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree-like structure illustrating the 
		hierarchical relationship between various HTML elements. It can be easily 
		explained as a tree of nodes generated by the browser. Each node has unique 
		properties and methods that can be changed using JavaScript.

	</p>
	<h2>
		A visual Representation of the DOM tree is shown in the image below.
	</h2>
	<img src="Tree.png">
	<ul>
		<li><b>Document</b> is the core/foundation of the DOM.</li>
		<li><b>HTML</b> root element is the child of the document object.</li>
		<li><b>Body</b> and Head elements are the children of the 
			HTML element and siblings to each other.</li>
		<li><b>Title</b> element is the parent to the text node: "my text‚Äù 
			and the child of the head element.</li>
		<li><b>a</b> tag and <b>h1</b> tag are the children of the body element 
			and siblings to each other.</li>
		<li><b>href</b> attribute is the children of the <b>a</b>(anchor) tag.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How to Select Elements in the DOM</h2>
	<p>
		In order to change or modify an element in the DOM, you need to select 
		that specific element. Thus, JavaScript has six methods to select an element 
		from a document in dom manipulation in javascript.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>getElementById:</b> returns an element whose id matches a passed string. Since the ids of elements are unique, this is the fastest way to select an element.</li>
		<li><b>getElementsByTagName:</b> returns a collection of all the elements present in the document that have the specified tag name, in the order of their appearance in the document.</li>
		<li><b>getElementsByClassName:</b> returns an HTMLCollection of elements that match the passed class name. Bypassing the class names separated by whitespace, we can search for multiple class names.</li>
		<li><b>getElementsByName:</b> returns a NodeList Collection of the elements that match the value of the name attribute with the passed string.</li>
		<li><b>querySelector:</b> returns the very first element within the document that matches the given selector. It only returns the element that matches with one of the specified CSS selectors, or a group of selectors.</li>
		<li><b>querySelectorAll:</b> returns a static NodeList of elements that matches with one or a group of selectors. If no element matches, an empty NodeList is returned.</l>
